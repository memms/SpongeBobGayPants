yeah kinda
those cfgs arent good
yes
i highly recommend removing legs from min. hitscan if u know how ti do it
if not ill just send u a dll
with some modifications
like smoke fix & damage indicators
etc
dll
i can screenshare me compiling idk
yea cuz those people run nightcore rats
this is a dll
how
and what would i achieve?
ye ik
god i miss fake angles
cuz rn my almost perfect reso is useless
desync
kinda is
if u got no resolvo = u miss(edited)
no fake angles
no need for a resolver
true
i was here for like 2 years
ye
look, i suggest looking at the valve sdk
and other sources to get a grasp of how things work(edited)
look at some aimbot/ esp tutorials online
since making an external cheat is easy
start with externals(edited)
and use hazed dumper
for offsets
then hardcode like a boss(edited)
go to void.to
aka pasters.cc
and check out "Rixile"
in releases
no thats an external
youre thinking of riptide
check it out
it has a good memory manager
yes
that aint good for beginners
i meam
i highly suggest u taking a look at rixile
its simple to understand
yes
it has triggerbobber and glow(edited)
and like other shit
and like noflash
and broken rcs
also for rcs
u need a vector class
and u write to memory like this
m->writemem<vector>(m->readmem<dword>(...));
(edited)
i mean u would get a syntax error
but u get the idea
fixed
yeah
u gotta figure out what goes there
hint: its literally on uc thread named c++ external rcs
try implementing rcs
should be easy
yes
it will teach u basics
of how to google
etc
it doesnt need to work
since it doesnt for me lol it just shoots at  0(edited)
ye its updated regularly
i mean
only thing thats changed is crosshair id offset
iirc
it does
uncommentedstuff
cpp or h i dont remember
not really
in the source
its named uncommented stuff
oh yea
txt
ii forgot

for mirror?
source is public lol
nigger dont use public cheats
*free public cheats
they are most likely detected
and you cant do anything to make them ud
XD
vmp doesnt do shit
doesnt change the signature
just packs the dll
lol
good luck finding a free cheat
that hits p
buy a cheat
then dont expect to "hit p"
lmao
its like getting into a shitty car and expecting to win a race
against supercars
i mean
mirror isnt confusing
but youre here for a month and a half
and you expect to make good configs & have a good playstyle
i dont think its the cheats fault youre getting owned tbh

wait for the other guy to move/peek
hvh requires patience
